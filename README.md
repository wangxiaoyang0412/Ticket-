# Ticket-Recommendation
The project aims to use personalization to improve ticket search and recommendation.
- Created Java servlets with RESTful APIs to handle HTTP requests and responses
- Built relational and NoSQL databases (MySQL, MongoDB) to capture event data (name, description, location, parking info)  from TicketMaster API
- Designed algorithms (e.g., content-based recommendation) to improve event recommendation based on search history and favorite records) 
- Deployed server to Amazon EC2 to handle 150 queries per second tested by Apache JMeter.
